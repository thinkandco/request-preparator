# request-preparator
This module prepares JSON request bodies for API testing

- In App.Java, update SOURCE_DIRECTORY with the path of directory where actual JSON files are present.
- The modified JSONs would be created in modified folder of the project root directory itself.
- For now, only the place holder 'ChangeThisFieldWithUUID' is replaced with the random UUID in modified JSONs.
